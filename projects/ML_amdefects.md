# Implant Defects in AM Parts for Process Control Study

Ho Yeung developed a method to implant more ‘realistic’ defects in additive manufactured parts, such as lowering the power to simulate a lack of fusion defect, raising the power to create an overheat zone (possible keyholing defect), and defocusing the laser to simulate lensing effect, etc., These defects can be created at random sizes and locations. Ho is planning to apply machine learning on the in-situ monitoring signals to study the process signatures from these defects created, and then use these signatures for real time process control and monitoring.
